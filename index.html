          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for
          example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is
          whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the
          student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of
          critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These
          disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of
          education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities
          of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field
          studying education. There are many types of education. Formal
          education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public
          schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside
          the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured
          learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education
          are divided into levels. They include early childhood education,
          primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other
          classifications focus on the teaching method, like teacher-centered
          and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be
          distinguished by subject, like science education, language education,
          and physical education. Education socializes children into society by
          teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills
          needed to become productive members of society. This way, it
          stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global
          problems.

          The definition of education has been explored by theorists from
          various fields.[1][2][3] Many agree that education is a purposeful
          activity aimed at achieving certain goals, which include the
          transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[4][1][5]
          However, there is extensive debate regarding its exact nature beyond
          these general features. Some theorists view education primarily as a
          process that occurs during educational events such as schooling,
          teaching, and learning.[6][7][2] Others perceive it not as a process
          but as the product resulting from this process, emphasizing the mental
          states and dispositions of educated persons.[6][7][2] Additionally,
          the term may also refer to an academic field that studies the methods,
          processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and
          learning.[7] The term "education" is derived from the Latin words
          educare, meaning "bring up, rear, educate", primarily related to the
          mind, and educere, meaning "bring out, lead forth", and refers to the
          bodily level.[8] Some theorists provide precise definitions by
          identifying the specific features that are exclusive to all forms of
          education. R. S. Peters, for instance, outlines three essential
          features for education:[9][10][1] It is concerned with the
          transmission of knowledge and understanding. This transmission is
          worthwhile. It is done in a morally appropriate manner in tune with
          the student's interests.[9][10][1] Such precise definitions often
          succeed at characterizing the most typical forms of education. But
          they are criticized because there are counterexamples.[10][11][2]
          These difficulties have led some theorists to develop less precise
          concepts. Some of them are based on family resemblance.

          Formal education plays a central role in modern civilization. But in
          primitive cultures, most of the education happened on the informal
          level.[23][37][38] This usually means that there is no distinction
          between activities focused on education and other activities. Instead,
          the whole environment acts as a form of school and most adults act as
          teachers. However, informal education is often not efficient enough to
          pass on large quantities of knowledge. To do so, a formal setting and
          well-trained teachers are usually required. This was one of the
          reasons why in the course of history, formal education became more and
          more important. In this process, the experience of education became
          more abstract and removed from daily life. More emphasis was put on
          grasping general patterns instead of observing and imitating
          behavior.Many other types of education are discussed in the academic
          literature, like the distinction between traditional and alternative
          education. Traditional education concerns long-established and
          mainstream schooling practices. It uses teacher-centered education and
          takes place in a well-regulated school environment. Regulations cover
          many aspects of education, such as the curriculum and the timeframe
          when classes start and end.[
